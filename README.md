#Player 1: Andrew Higgins
#Player 2: Jack Rogers


Our code creates a 2d Char board initalized to: (disregard all '#' for the duration of this README.md)
#- #- #-
#- #- #-
#- #- #-

Then our code allows keyboard input 1-9 to designate squares as such
#1 #2 #3
#4 #5 #6 
#7 #8 #9 

And by entering a Character 'x' or 'o', players claim a position
For example 5, x would result in
#- #- #-
#- #x #-
#- #- #-

Next input might be 1 o
#o #- #-
#- #x #-
#- #- #-

and the game continues for up to 9 moves.
